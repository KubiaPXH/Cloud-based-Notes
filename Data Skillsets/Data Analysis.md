## What is Data Analysis?
```ad-definition
**Data Analysis** is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusion and supporting decision-making
- from raw (untidy) data -> clean data: inspecting, cleansing, transforming.
- exploring and modeling: modeling data -> using inferential stats to see if any pattern or model arise.
- pattern and model reveal useful information, which need to be evidence-based (informing) and presented in a clever way(s) (dashboard with different views) to support decision-making.
