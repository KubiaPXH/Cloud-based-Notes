- Apply in low proposal time (choose good time zone: US day - France afternoon) <- tracking!
- Sincere/To the point proposals:
	- no bot or copy/paste
	- already read the description? -> mention some main keywords -> what you can help! more than the demand? (some bonus work -> way to develop things better!!)
	- why you are (the best) suit for the work?
	- share similar tasks you have done before.
When starting out, I had more or less similar experiences. I would love to share some of my own tips too. For example, when sending proposals, make sure to share similar tasks that you have done before. In the beginning, I used to even create content after looking at a job description, just so that I could send it as a sample task that Ive done before. Also, up front communication with the client is very important. Be transparent and don't pretend to know more than what you actually know. You don't exactly need to know everything. Even today I'm still learning. I've recently discovered the Codebasics channel, and its helping me get back to basics and understand the internal details of machine learning algorithms. Thanks!
	- short proposal, but show what need and essiential!
